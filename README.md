# Coding Quiz Challenge

## Description

A short coding quiz to demonstrate JavaScript coding skills with DOM, timers, arrays, and localStorage. My motivation was to learn how to properly utilize timers and localStorage. The big thing I've taken away from this challenge was manipulation of arrays, and how to set/get from localStorage.
